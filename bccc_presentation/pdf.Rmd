## My goal is to act as a **bridge** for students.


### I aim to influence and encourage students, and I connect them to the next steps while building **language proficiency**, **cultural competence**, and **general skills** that will serve them beyond the classroom. 


---


## My Spanish lessons follow ACTFL guiding principles to focus meaning and communicative activities.


---

## Within these meaning-driven language lessons, I integrate the **5 C's of Language Education**.

--

### **Communication** in more than one language for a variety of situations.

--

### Creating **cultural** competence.

--

### Making **connections** with other disciplines.

--

### Making **comparisons** between cultures and languages.

--

### Engaging **communities** at home and abroad.


---

# A practical example: Backward design structure

--

### Identify desired results... 

--

### THEN determine acceptable evidence...

--

### THEN plan learning experiences and instruction. 

---

## We want to learn **-ar verb conjugations** in the present tense.

--

Acceptable evidence: Given an infinitive, the student can **produce a sentence** using the correct form of a verb and **generalize** this ability to novel words.

# An example: Let's cook! 

--

### 1. Introduce authentic cultural material (a recipe in Spanish).

--

### 2. Do an interpretive activity.

--

### 3. Zoom in on the grammatical aspects of the material.

--

### 4. Do guided practice.

--

### 5. Check for understanding with the acceptable evidence activity.

# Conclusion


### I am eager to act as not just an instructor, but a **bridge for students** to connect them to new resources and paths forward.

--

### I want to **give back to my home state**: I have been privileged and gained many unique experiences in my work.

--

### If desired, I can supervise or involve students in **undergraduate research**.
