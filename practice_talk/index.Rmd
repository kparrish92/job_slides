In L3 acquisition, we **do not know the underlying process(es)** that generates the data.

<br>
<br>
At least two possibilities exist: 

  .blue[a]. The process is similar for all people with respect to direction and relative magnitude.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, the data we observe may be better explained by **distinct underlying data-generating processes determined by individual factors**, rather than a universal truth about L3 acquisition.

<!-- The point is that the mean, made up of many individual data points, has the potential not to be for making determinations about the data that calculated it.

The analogy refers to group models in linguistic research - we detect an effect on the basis of many individuals - and make recs based on the effect that is analogous to the mean.

But, especially as the variation of individual effects increases, the validity of this effect to make impactful and informed decisions on the basis of experimental work decreases  

My main argument is that, b/c we make decisions that are based upon groups of individuals without always verifying that the treatment/effect is present in all of them, that many studies cannot conclusively say that all participants exhibit a behavior said to be true. -->

## **Study 2**: A simulation of VOT in L3 learners 

---

class: title-slide-section, middle
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### **Questions**: 

--

### RQ1: If the underlying truth is that data generation has unique underlying processes, **how many observations per participant** per language do we need?

--

### RQ2: If we consider participants who are learning the same language as belonging to the same experimental group, how reliable is our group level estimate for determining individual performance?

---

class: title-slide-section, middle
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### **In other words**: What if both the TPM and the LPM are right? And it varies by individual?

--

Three unique data generation processes:

When the L2 VOT > L1 VOT (as it would be in Spanish L1 English L2)

The L3 is L1-like
The L3 is L2-like
The L3 is a small effect size below the L2.

# A simulation study

.large[
The study simulated experimental data of the pronunciation of a **voiceless stop consonant** (p) produced by trilingual speakers of L1 Spanish, L2 English and L3 French
]

--

.large[
Spanish was simulated with the lowest VOT (mean = 10, sd = 10)
English was simulated with the higher VOT (mean = 70, sd = 20)
]

--

.large[
French was simulated with one of three processes (33% each):

a. Equal to Spanish
b. Equal to English
c. 15ms less than English (mean = 55, sd = 20)

# A simulation study

.large[
The first goal of the simulation was to determine how much data is needed to accurately categorize each of the participants at least 80% of the times.

# Take aways 


.large[
Much more data are needed on the individual level if there are distinct underlying data-generating processes.

--

.large[
Rather than focusing on large groups, zooming in on the individual in a series of case studies would shed light on whether this may be the case.

.large[
As the total data-set increases in size, the probability of an intermediate group effect increases - even though it is only true for 1/3 of participants.

This result biases interpretations and makes interventions on the basis of the data less equitable as the variation increases.

# In the works

Propose a service learning class that helps the community and generates interesting data.

Longitudinal design examining the impact of service learning on language proficiency.
  - Meaningful language use in the advanced development of L2 and L3 phonetic categories. 
  - Good for Creighton because of a diverse community and affluent student body.
